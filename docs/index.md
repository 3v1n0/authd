# authd

authd is an authentication service for Ubuntu that integrates with multiple
cloud identity providers. It offers a secure interface for system
authentication, enabling cloud-based identity management for Ubuntu Desktop and
Server.

authd has a modular design, comprising an authentication daemon and various
identity brokers. This enables authd to support a growing list of cloud
identity providers. Currently, authd supports authentication with both [MS
Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/whatis) and
[Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview). An example broker is
also provided to help developers create new brokers for additional identity
services.

If an organization is pursuing cloud-based authentication of Ubuntu
workstations and servers, authd is a secure and versatile service to support a
full transition to the cloud.
